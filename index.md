# Week 1 
* I first chose my sensor for the hardware project for semester 5 of this course. It was the INA219 High-Side DC Current/Voltage sensor
* Created my repository to store my files in
# Week 2
* I created and submitted my proposal this week
* Start working on my project plan for week 3
# Week 3 
* Completed my proposal
* Continue my research for the project

# Week 4
* Figured out what I need to purchase for the project
* Submitted my budget proposal to the instuctor
* Buy all the needed Items
# Week 5 
* Bought my parts and here is my proof of purchase

# Week 6 
* The parts came in and now im ready to begin the assignment
* Met with my psuedo code assignment group and, completed the assignment

# Week 8
* I was not able to complete my raspberry pi setup in time, but I used one of my classmates raspberry pi to show that my sensor is properly working
* At first the address that was being displayed was not the one that is required. The address on the sensor was 0x40 instead of 0x4C. I needed to change the address on the sensor, and you can achieve this by connecting A0 to GND and A1 to SCL. A0 and A1 are GND by default so all I needed to do was connect A1 to SCL.
