### Record Progress of the Project
Building this project will require time and commitment and I believe the best way to keep track of this progress is to write it to a blog. 
In other words, to set up a website and using GitHub to host it. 

### Introduction using a system diagram
![Schematic Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LosesonWinson/CurrentSensor/master/sysdia.png)
This schematic diagram will help assist in replicating CurrentSensor. The purpose of this project is to detect current read from the sensor.
